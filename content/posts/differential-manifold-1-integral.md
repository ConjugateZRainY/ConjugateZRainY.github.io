This series is expected to consist of three articles.
1. From the definition of manifolds to integration on manifolds.
2. From Lie groups to integration on Lie groups and invariant measures.
3. From connections, involving Riemannian manifolds, arriving at the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorem and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.

Differential manifolds are the venue for many modern applications in algebra and analysis. Consequently, many tools appear to be strokes of genius, available at one's fingertips. What this article describes is merely a logical construction; the actual developmental path in the history of mathematics was considerably more complex.

# 流形、Manifold、多様体、Mannigfaltigkeit

To generalize calculus from Euclidean space to more general "spaces," we first ask: what kind of space is qualified to host calculus? The most natural extension and the most reasonable answer is a topological space that "looks like Euclidean space locally"—meaning the neighborhood of every point can be flattened into a standard \(\mathbb{R}^n\). We call such a space a **manifold**, denoted as \(\mathcal{M}\). This requirement of being "locally Euclidean" is the definition most commonly used in textbooks today.

- This definition is **intrinsic**: We care only about the structure of \(\mathcal{M}\) itself, without assuming it lies within some larger background space. Hermann Weyl was the first to explicitly propose this view during his lectures, and it later became the mainstream approach. The subtext of the intrinsic view is: no matter how the background space or local coordinates transform, the inherent properties remain maintained and do not change accordingly.
- In contrast, Vladimir Arnold preferred the **extrinsic** perspective: first acknowledge that the entire Euclidean space is a manifold, and then view the "surfaces" and "curves" seen in daily life directly as subsets (submanifolds) of Euclidean space. According to the Whitney Embedding Theorem, any \(n\)-dimensional intrinsic manifold can be embedded into some \(2n\)-dimensional Euclidean space; thus, the two perspectives are mathematically equivalent—only the starting points differ.

In modern pedagogy, **atlases** and **smooth transition maps** are used to strictly define differential manifolds. For every point on the manifold \(\mathcal{M}\), we can establish a **coordinate chart** \((U, \phi)\). A collection of coordinate charts \(\{(U_{\alpha}, \phi_{\alpha})\}\) constitutes an atlas, much like a map guiding one through the entire manifold. Smooth transition requires that for any two coordinate charts \((U, \phi)\) and \((V, \psi)\) with overlapping parts, the map \(\phi \circ \psi^{-1}\) must be smooth. This is because a single point may be covered by multiple charts. Between smooth manifolds, there can be smooth maps \(f: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{N}\).

# From Extrinsic to Intrinsic, Tangent Vectors to Derivations

At a point \(p\) on a manifold, we can conceive of defining a tangent space \( T_p \mathcal{M}\), the elements of which are called tangent vectors. Geometric intuition can lead to many examples, such as the tangent plane that can be constructed at every point on a sphere in three-dimensional Euclidean space. From here on, things begin to get magical.

Geometric intuition is extrinsic; it assumes the sphere "sits" inside three-dimensional space. At a point \(p\) on the sphere (say, the North Pole), where should a non-zero tangent vector \(v\) point?
If you view the sphere as embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, there is no problem. The vector \(v\) is a vector in the 3D Euclidean space, lying on the plane tangent to the sphere at point \(p\). But note that the endpoint of this vector (unless it is the zero vector), \(p + v\), is no longer on the sphere. It pokes out!

Switching to the intrinsic perspective, if we only know the sphere itself and are unaware of an enclosing 3D Euclidean background space, the operation \(p + v\) becomes completely meaningless. The manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) itself is not a vector space; one cannot add a point and a "vector" to get another point on the manifold. The direction of the "arrow" is meaningless. Therefore, the classic "arrow" model either relies on a larger ambient space (extrinsic perspective) or cannot be defined at all within the pure manifold. To build a theory dependent only on the manifold's own structure, we must discard the model of regarding tangent vectors as "arrows." This also implies an upgrade to the old perspective—actually, in \(p + v\), \(p\) and \(v\) are not in the same space. This can be further extended to the concept of generalized coordinates in physics. There is essentially a perspective upgrade here: vectors are not just arrays of components; functions can also be vectors. As long as it is an Abelian group. Do not be misled by the framework of coordinates.

To obtain the intrinsic perspective and shake off this dependency, modern mathematics made an algebraic choice. Mathematicians discovered that the role of a tangent vector is to compute the rate of change of a function along a certain direction. For a tangent vector \(v = (v^1, \cdots, v^n)\) at a point \(p\) in Euclidean space, the directional derivative of a function \(f\) at this location is \(D_v f\big|_p = v^i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\big|_p\) (using Einstein summation convention).

Now, we view the tangent vector as an **operator** acting on smooth functions on the manifold: \(X_p(\cdot) = D_v (\cdot)\). That is, \(X_p : C^\infty(U) \to \mathbb{R}\), which accepts a smooth function \(f\) on the manifold and returns the directional derivative \(X_p(f)\). Aside from studying what operational rules the operator satisfies, we have no other choice. \(X_p\) is a linear operator. Crucially, \(X_p\) is a **derivation** (satisfying the Leibniz rule). The tangent space \( T_p \mathcal{M}\) is the set of these \(X_p\).

Due to linearity, \( T_p \mathcal{M}\) is a linear space. We must then ask:

- Does this linear space have a dual space?
- Is this linear space infinite-dimensional or finite-dimensional?
  - If finite-dimensional, what is the dimension?

The dimension of the tangent space \( T_p \mathcal{M}\) is exactly the same as that of the manifold \(\mathcal{M}\). Although we introduced the abstract definition of derivations to define tangent vectors without relying on external coordinates, to study the structure of this abstract space, we must rely on coordinate charts—the only tool capable of concrete calculation. What we do now is move from the abstract to specific calculation. Using the local coordinates \((x^1, \cdots, x^n)\) given by a local chart \((U, \phi)\), and according to **Hadamard's Lemma**, we know that \(X_p(f) = X_p(x^i) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\Big|_p \). This shows that the partial derivatives \( \left \{\frac{\partial }{\partial x^i}\Big|_p \right \}\) form a basis for \( T_p \mathcal{M}\). Naturally, the dual space of the tangent space—the **cotangent space** \( T_p^* \mathcal{M}\)—also has a dual basis denoted as \( \{dx^i\}\), satisfying the operational rule \(dx^i(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} x^i = \delta^{i}_j\). Thus, the dual operation is defined as \(df(X_p) = X_p(f) \), where \(df\) is an element of the cotangent space. It is not hard to obtain the classic result \(df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} dx^i\).

One way of defining this is to consider a curve \(c(t): (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \to M\) on the manifold \(\mathcal{M}\), which passes through point \(p\) at \(t=0\). Geometrically, \(c'(0)\) is the tangent vector at point \(p\). But this definition is obviously not intrinsic. Calculating the derivative requires us to compute \(c(h) - c(0)\), and since the manifold may not be a vector space, subtraction is impossible unless we place it in an external context and view it as a vector in Euclidean space—which returns us to the extrinsic perspective. Therefore, we cannot view \(c'(0)\) as a "vector," but rather as a derivation acting on smooth functions at \(p\), i.e.,
\(c'(0) f = \frac{d(f \circ c)}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}\). Since the curve \(c\) can be chosen in many ways, we define the tangent vector via the equivalence class of curves such that at \(t=0\), \(c(0)=p\) and \(c'(0) f\) are all equal. Tangent vectors are obtained by classifying according to this equivalence relation.

The curve definition is like a scaffold; it can explain some motivations and derive algebraic conclusions, after which the scaffolding of the curve definition can be removed. We just discussed the content of a single manifold. We can also use the curve definition to derive the definition of transition maps (push-forwards). If \(F: \mathcal M \to \mathcal N\) is a map from manifold \(\mathcal M\) to \(\mathcal N\), and defining \(p\) and \(c(t)\) as before, then \(F \circ c\) is a curve on manifold \(\mathcal N\) passing through point \(F(p)\). The question now is: what happens to the tangent vector \(X_p\) at \(p\) under the mapping? If \(g:C^{\infty}_{F(p)}(\mathcal N) \to \mathbb R\), we can differentiate to get
\[\begin{aligned}
  (F \circ c)'(0)[g] &= \frac{d}{dt} (g \circ F \circ c) \Big|_{t=0} \\
&= c'(0)[g \circ F] \end{aligned}\]
Based on this, we can obtain the derivation \(\bar{X}_{F(p)} g = X_p(g \circ F)\). Thus, we define the push-forward \(F_{*, p} : T_p \mathcal M \to T_{F(p)}\mathcal N\), with the rule \(F_{*,p}(X_p)[g] = X_p(g \circ F) \). As the name implies, push-forward pushes the tangent vector at \(p\) on \(\mathcal M\) to \(F(p)\) on \(\mathcal N\). We will not delve deeply into the category theory background here.

These definitions present a kind of uniqueness. Defining the **pull-back** operation \(F^*: T^*_{F(p)}\mathcal N \to T^*_{p} \mathcal M\), where \((F^*w)_{p}X_p = \omega_{F(p)}\bar{X}_{F(p)} = \omega_{F(p)} F_* X_{p}\), is actually a bit by necessity. Literally, pull-back means pulling functions or differential forms on manifold \(\mathcal N\) back to \(\mathcal M\).

# Differential Structure: The Glue from Point to Field

Now, to solve the problem of integration on manifolds, we need to find a smooth differential form \(d\omega\) that is not limited to a single point but defined over the entire manifold. To connect the tangent space and cotangent space at every point, this leads to the tangent bundle \(T \mathcal{M}\) and the cotangent bundle \(T^* \mathcal{M}\). The tangent bundle is the disjoint union of tangent spaces, \(T \mathcal{M} = \sqcup_{p \in \mathcal{M}} T_p \mathcal M = \cup_{p \in \mathcal{M}} \{p\} \times T_p \mathcal M\). Thus, we can define vector fields \(X: p \to X_p\) and 1-forms \(\omega: p \to \omega_p\) over the entire manifold. \(T_p \mathcal M\) is the fiber growing out of point \(p\). For every point \(p\), selecting a specific \(X_p\) allows us to define a section on the manifold. Imagine a barber cutting a customer's hair; the electric clippers glide flatly across the hair, leaving a section (the hair follicle is \(p\), the scalp is the manifold, every strand of hair is the fiber \(T_p \mathcal M\), and the haircut is the section operation).

Differential forms, the definition of Wedge, exterior differentiation—all these are constructed in reverse from the Generalized Stokes' Theorem \(\int_{\partial \mathcal M} \omega = \int_{\mathcal M } d \omega\). Only with a wedge product satisfying antisymmetry does its behavior under coordinate transformation perfectly and automatically match the Jacobian determinant in the integration change of variables formula.

To define the Wedge product, we must talk about the tensor product. The tensor product \(\otimes\) is defined for multilinear maps. For example, for \(V \otimes V\), by modding out the ideal \(I\) generated by elements of the form \(v \otimes v\), \(V \otimes V / I\) becomes antisymmetric, and this is where the wedge product comes from. The exterior derivative is an anti-derivation and satisfies \(d^2 = 0\), from which we can define chain complexes.

# Integration on Manifolds

Returning to integration on manifolds, we cannot calculate directly on a curved space, but we can break the problem down into countless small pieces that can be solved in flat Euclidean space, and then smooth paste the results together. One cannot integrate arbitrarily on any manifold because we are dealing with oriented integration. An \(n\)-dimensional manifold is orientable if and only if there exists a nowhere-vanishing \(n\)-form, which defines a sign for the tangent space at every point, ensuring that the value of the integral does not differ by a sign due to the choice of coordinates.

If a single coordinate chart \((U, \phi)\) can cover the entire manifold, then the integral on it can be pulled back to Euclidean space, \( \int_{U} \omega = \int_{\phi(U)} (\phi^{-1})^* \omega \). If there are multiple coordinate charts, we use a partition of unity. The most important point in the technique of partition of unity is local finiteness, which ensures the sum of the decomposition is a finite sum. The partition of unity restricts the differential forms on the atlas to each coordinate chart, while the value of the integral remains independent of the choice of the partition of unity. The proof of the Generalized Stokes' Theorem, in addition to applying integration on manifolds, also utilizes the definition of manifolds with boundary. This application to manifolds with boundary \(\mathcal H^n\) is similar in purpose to the Trace Theorem in Sobolev spaces.

Finally, due to the exact property of \(d^2 = 0\), and the adjoint relationship between \(d\) and \(\partial \) obtained from the Generalized Stokes' Theorem, we derive de Rham cohomology theory. Undoubtedly, with these, we can use many tools from homological algebra, such as the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.
