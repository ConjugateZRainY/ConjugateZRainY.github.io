title: 'The Pronunciation Method of Latin'
---

In this post, I want to share some interesting observations from my journey learning Latin. The pronunciation rules are much more logical than I expected.

## Consonant Sounds

There are a few specific quirks in Latin consonants that differ from English:

The "BS/BT" Assimilation:
When bs or bt appear together, they are pronounced like ps and pt.
Example: _Urbs_ sounds like Urps; _obtinere_ sounds like optinere.

- The Letter "R":
The Latin R is always rolled (trilled), just like in Italian or Spanish. It is not the guttural (throat) R used in French or German.
- _Littera Canina_ (The Dog Letter):
Because of this trilling sound, the Romans actually nicknamed the letter R the _littera canina_ (the dog letter). To them, a rolling R sounded like a growling dog (grrrr).

## Rules of Syllable Quantity (Length)

Before understanding the accent, we have to understand "Quantity" (Length). A syllable in Latin counts as "heavy" (or long) in two ways:

- By Nature: The vowel itself is long (often marked with a macron, like ā, ē, ī).
- By Position: The vowel is short, but it is "blocked" by two or more consonants following it.
Note: This makes the syllable "heavy," which attracts the stress.
__Vowel before Vowel is Short!__

## Rules of Stress (Accent)

Latin stress is surprisingly simple. It relies entirely on the penultimate syllable (the second-to-last one).

- Rule A: Two-Syllable Words
This is the easiest one. The stress is always on the second-to-last syllable (which is the first syllable). Example: _RO-sa_, _A-mo_.

- Rule B: Words with 3+ Syllables
For longer words, you only need to look at the second-to-last syllable:
Is it heavy/long? (Is the vowel long or followed by two consonants?)
YES: Stress stays there. (e.g., _a-MĀ-vi_, _ma-GIS-ter_)
Is it light/short?
NO: The stress falls back to the third-to-last syllable. (e.g., _FA-ci-lis_, _DO-mi-nus_)

Summary: Don't memorize long lists of rules. Just check the second-to-last syllable. If it's strong, stress it. If it's weak, step back.

## Rules of Connected Speech in Latin

1. Elision (The "Drop" Rule)
When a word ends in a vowel and the next begins with one, drop the first vowel.
Note: A final -m or an initial -h are treated as "weak" sounds—they do not block this rule.
Example: _te amo_ → _t'amo_; _monstrum horrendum_ → _monstr'orrendum_.

2. Prodelision (The "Est" Exception)
If a word ends in a vowel (or -m) and meets the verb _est_ (or _es_), drop the _e_ in _est_ instead.
Example: _homo est_ → _homost_.

3. Liaison (Linking)
When a word ends in a consonant and the next begins with a vowel, link them together smoothly.
Example: _ab ovo_ → _a-bo-vo_.

## Exercises

Now let us analyze the following three lines of poetry:

- Syllable division: separate with a hyphen.
- Stress marking: bold or CAPITALIZE the stressed syllable.
- Elision / Liaison marking:
  - For elision, enclose the dropped vowel in parentheses ( ).
  - For prodelision of “_est_,” put the _e_ of _est_ in parentheses.
  - For ordinary liaison, underline _ to connect.
